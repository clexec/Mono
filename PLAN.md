# THERE Music — Full Spotify Clone with Auth, Player, Search & Library

## What We're Building

A complete iOS music streaming app called **THERE Music** — a Spotify clone with a warm brown color palette instead of green. Full authentication (Apple, Google, Email), real music playback from iTunes, personalized Home feed, Search with genres, Your Library, comments on tracks, queue management, and App Store-ready polish.

## Design & Visual Style

- **Color palette**: Warm browns — #D4A574 accent, #6B4423 secondary, #000000 background, #B3B3B3 text — completely replacing Spotify green
- **Dark theme by default** with a light theme option in Settings
- **iOS native glass effects** — .ultraThinMaterial on tab bar, mini-player, and cards; .glassEffect() on iOS 26
- **Real SF Symbols icons** throughout — no drawn images, no emoji icons
- **Smooth spring animations** for player transitions and button presses
- **Minimalist Spotify-like layout** — album artwork is the hero on every screen
