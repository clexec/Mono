## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

#### Key Points:

**Naming:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for types and protocols
- Prefix boolean properties with `is`, `has`, `should`

```swift
// Good
var isPlaying: Bool
func fetchUserPlaylists() async

// Bad
var playing: Bool
func getUserPlaylists() async
```

**Code Organization:**
- Use `// MARK: -` to organize code sections
- Group related functionality together
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
private var player: AVPlayer?

// MARK: - Lifecycle
override func viewDidLoad() { }

// MARK: - Actions
@objc private func handlePlayPause() { }

// MARK: - Helpers
private func configurePlayer() { }
```

**SwiftUI:**
- Extract complex views into separate components
- Use computed properties for view builders
- Keep body implementations concise

```swift
// Good
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        headerView
        contentView
        footerView
    }
}

private var headerView: some View {
    // Complex header logic
}
```

**Async/Await:**
- Prefer async/await over completion handlers
- Use proper error handling with try/catch
- Mark functions as `async throws` when appropriate

```swift
func fetchTracks() async throws -> [Track] {
    let data = try await networkService.fetch()
    return try decoder.decode([Track].self, from: data)
}
```

### Architecture

- Follow **MVVM** pattern
- Use **Repository** for data layer
- Implement **Dependency Injection**
- Keep ViewModels testable
